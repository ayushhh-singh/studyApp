# Operations

## Architecture

- **Web** (`apps/web`): Vite SPA, deployed to **Cloudflare Pages (Free)** —
  the current ₹0 deploy target. `apps/web/public/_redirects` +
  `apps/web/public/_headers` (copied verbatim into `dist/` by Vite's normal
  `public/` handling — no extra build step) cover the SPA fallback + caching
  rules. `apps/web/vercel.json` is kept, unused, as the **paid upgrade path**
  (Vercel) — see "Upgrading to paid" below. Don't delete either config.
- **API** (`apps/api`): Express, deployed to **Render's FREE web service
  tier** — the current ₹0 deploy target — via `apps/api/Dockerfile`. No cron
  jobs on the free tier (Render Cron Jobs need a paid plan); every background
  job instead runs as a **GitHub Actions scheduled workflow**
  (`.github/workflows/{ca-run,daily-build,qgen-topup,nightly-settle,
  notifications,backup}.yml`). `render.yaml` is kept, unused-on-this-path, as
  the **paid upgrade path** (Render Starter + first-class Cron Jobs) — see
  "Upgrading to paid" below. Don't delete it.
- **Database**: Supabase cloud Postgres + pgvector — the SAME project used
  for local dev and production (per CLAUDE.md). No separate prod project.
- **Runtime note**: the API's production start command is `pnpm start` →
  `tsx src/index.ts`, not `node dist/index.js`. `@prayasup/shared` ships raw
  `.ts` source with no build step (a deliberate project decision), so plain
  `node` cannot resolve/execute it — `tsx` (a real dependency of `apps/api`,
  not a devDependency) is the production runtime, exactly as it already is in
  dev (`tsx watch`). This is true on both the free and paid Render paths.
  Don't "fix" this back to `node dist/index.js` without first giving
  `@prayasup/shared` an actual build step.

## Free-tier (₹0) deploy — current target

### Cloudflare Pages (web)

- **Build command**: `pnpm --filter web build`
- **Build output directory**: `apps/web/dist`
- **Root directory**: repo root (NOT `apps/web`) — this is a pnpm workspace;
  Cloudflare needs to run `pnpm install` at the monorepo root so
  `@prayasup/shared`'s workspace symlink resolves before Vite builds.
- **Environment variables** (Pages dashboard → your project → Settings →
  Environment variables — set for both Production and Preview):
  `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`,
  `VITE_API_URL=https://<render-service>.onrender.com`,
  `VITE_VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`, optionally `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`. Also set
  `PNPM_VERSION=9.0.0` — Cloudflare Pages auto-detects pnpm from the
  committed `pnpm-lock.yaml`, but its build image's default pnpm version
  won't necessarily match this repo's pinned `packageManager: pnpm@9.0.0`
  (root `package.json`); an unpinned newer major version could parse or
  regenerate the lockfile differently.
- **Prerendering is a separate, optional step** — same rationale as before
  (needs a Playwright Chromium binary at build time, fragile on a managed
  build image); it is NOT wired into the Pages build command. Run
  `pnpm --filter web prerender` locally (or in a separate CI job you control)
  after a build and publish the resulting `dist/{en,hi}/index.html` +
  `dist/{en,hi}/pricing/index.html` snapshots if you want them live — see
  "Prerendering" below for exactly how Cloudflare serves them.

#### Verified against `wrangler pages dev` (live, not assumed)

Ran `pnpm --filter web build && pnpm --filter web prerender`, then
`wrangler pages dev dist` (wrangler 4.108.0) and hit real routes:

- **Exact-match static files win over the `_redirects` fallback**, as
  required: `/en/`, `/hi/`, `/en/pricing/`, `/hi/pricing/` all served the real
  prerendered snapshot (confirmed via distinct `<title>` text and byte size —
  e.g. `/en/` returned the real "AI evaluation for your UPPSC Mains answers"
  title at 29,236 bytes, not the generic 1,603-byte SPA shell). Unmatched
  routes (`/en/dashboard`, `/nonexistent-route`, `/`) correctly fall back to
  the plain SPA shell (200, generic title) for client-side routing to take
  over.
- **TRAILING-SLASH GOTCHA (real, disclosed — unlike Vercel)**: Cloudflare
  Pages issues a **308 redirect** from `/en` → `/en/` (and `/en/pricing` →
  `/en/pricing/`) before serving the prerendered file — confirmed via
  `curl -D -`. Vercel's static server, by contrast, serves `/en` directly
  with no redirect (see the existing Prerendering note below). This is
  Cloudflare's own asset-server directory-index behavior, not something
  `_redirects` controls, and it means `PageSeo`'s canonical/hreflang tags
  (`apps/web/src/components/seo/page-seo.tsx`), which declare the
  **no-trailing-slash** form (e.g. `https://prayasup.app/en`), point at a URL
  that itself redirects to a different URL. Most crawlers handle a
  redirect-to-canonical chain fine, but it's not byte-identical — a real,
  minor SEO wrinkle, not fixed here (fixing it means either always emitting a
  trailing slash in `PageSeo`, or reaching for Cloudflare's `html_handling`
  config; both are scope creep for a deploy-config pass). Flagged for
  whoever next touches SEO.
- **The `_redirects` file's `/* /index.html 200` rule appears to be a no-op
  on current Cloudflare tooling** — `wrangler pages dev` (the LOCAL dev
  simulator; this was not re-checked against a real deployed Pages site,
  since that needs a Cloudflare account this environment doesn't have) logs
  it as an "invalid redirect rule... infinite loop detected" and ignores it
  (a known interaction between an explicit index.html rewrite and
  Cloudflare's own newer default trailing-slash/html-handling
  normalization). Confirmed by removing the file entirely in the same local
  simulator: unmatched routes still correctly 200 with the SPA shell,
  because Cloudflare Pages' asset server has its own built-in SPA-fallback
  independent of `_redirects`. wrangler's redirect-parsing is meant to
  mirror the real edge behavior, so this should hold in production too — but
  since it wasn't verified against an actual deploy, watch the very first
  real Cloudflare Pages deployment's build/function logs for the same
  warning (or any actual redirect-loop symptom) before fully trusting it.
  The rule is kept regardless — it's the standard documented Cloudflare
  Pages SPA pattern, harmless if it's really ignored, and is exactly what
  would be needed if Cloudflare's default behavior ever changes.
- **`_headers` cache rules verified live**: `GET /assets/<hashed>.js` →
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`; `GET /sw.js` →
  `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, must-revalidate` — byte-identical intent
  to `vercel.json`'s `headers` block.

### Render (API) — FREE web service

- Same `apps/api/Dockerfile` and `healthCheckPath: /api/v1/health` as the
  paid Blueprint, just created as a plain **Free** web service (Render
  dashboard → New → Web Service → connect the repo, Dockerfile path
  `apps/api/Dockerfile`, build context repo root) instead of via
  `render.yaml`'s Blueprint flow (which defaults every service to
  `plan: starter` — confirmed against Render's current Blueprint spec docs:
  `free` IS a valid `plan` value for a web service, just explicitly **not**
  for private services, background workers, or Cron Jobs — consistent with
  "no Cron Jobs on the free tier" below). Render's docs don't explicitly
  confirm or deny Docker-runtime support specifically on the free plan (only
  that Docker is a supported runtime in general) — if the dashboard doesn't
  offer Docker as a free-plan option when you get there, this app doesn't
  strictly need it: `apps/api` has no build step of its own (`tsx` runs the
  raw TypeScript directly, per the Runtime note above), so a native **Node**
  environment works too — build command `pnpm install --filter api...`,
  start command `pnpm --filter api start`. No Cron Jobs on this tier either
  way — every job that would have been a Render Cron Job is now a GitHub
  Actions scheduled workflow (below).
- **Env vars**: the same set documented in `render.yaml`'s `prayasup-secrets`
  group — `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
  `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `QGEN_BATCH_MAX_USD` (default `5`), `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`/
  `_SECRET`/`_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY`/`_PRIVATE_KEY`/`_SUBJECT`,
  optionally `SENTRY_DSN`, plus `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (your Pages domain) and,
  if you want Cloudflare Pages' per-branch preview deploys to also work
  against this API, `ALLOWED_ORIGIN_SUFFIXES=.<project-name>.pages.dev` —
  **scoped to your own project name, NOT the bare `.pages.dev`**, since
  Cloudflare Pages project names aren't namespaced per account and a bare
  suffix would trust every Pages project anyone else creates too (see
  `apps/api/src/index.ts`'s CORS setup, unchanged from the paid path). Set
  these directly on the service via Render's dashboard Environment tab —
  there's no Blueprint env-var-group convenience on this manual-create path.
- **FREE-TIER TRADEOFF (state this to users honestly)**: per Render's own
  docs, free web services **spin down after 15 minutes of no inbound
  traffic**, and the next request pays a **cold start of roughly a minute**
  while the service restarts. Two mitigations, neither eliminates it entirely:
  1. An external uptime monitor (e.g. UptimeRobot's free plan, 5-minute
     interval) pinging `GET https://<render-service>.onrender.com/api/v1/health`
     keeps the service warm during normal traffic hours.
  2. The GitHub Actions cron workflows below invoke their scripts directly
     via `tsx` against Supabase — they do **not** hit the deployed Render
     HTTP service at all, so don't rely on them to keep it warm.
  - Bottom line: the very first request after an idle stretch (e.g. a user
    opening the app first thing in the morning) can take up to a minute
    before anything loads. This is the honest, disclosed cost of ₹0 —
    eliminating it means the paid Starter plan (see "Upgrading to paid").
  - Check Render's current free-tier CPU/RAM limits in their dashboard before
    relying on this for real traffic — these numbers change and shouldn't be
    hardcoded here from memory.

### Cron/scheduled work — GitHub Actions

Every background job that `render.yaml` runs as a Render Cron Job has an
equivalent GitHub Actions scheduled workflow under `.github/workflows/`:
`ca-run.yml`, `daily-build.yml`, `qgen-topup.yml`, `nightly-settle.yml`,
`notifications.yml` — plus a new `backup.yml` with no Render equivalent (see
"Weekly encrypted DB backup" below). Each workflow: checks out the repo,
sets up pnpm + Node 22 (with pnpm's dependency cache), runs
`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --filter api...` (installs only `apps/api`
and its workspace deps — `@prayasup/shared` — not `apps/web`'s much heavier
toolchain), then runs the relevant `pnpm --filter api <script>` with secrets
injected as env vars. Each has `workflow_dispatch` for manual runs and a
`concurrency` group (no `cancel-in-progress`) so a slow run finishes rather
than getting killed mid-write, with the next scheduled tick queuing behind it
instead of overlapping.

**GitHub Actions cron is best-effort** — expect several minutes of drift
under GitHub-wide load; never treat these schedules as a precise clock (the
same caveat Render Cron Jobs' UTC-only schedule field already carried, just a
different kind of imprecision). **Scheduled workflows are automatically
paused after 60 days with zero repository activity** — any push/commit
resets that clock. If a job silently stops firing, check the repo's Actions
tab for a "workflow disabled" banner before assuming something else broke.

**`qgen-topup` is not a quick job** — it submits a real Anthropic Message
Batch and polls for it to finish (`src/lib/anthropic.ts`'s `runBatch`), which
this codebase's own comment notes "take[s] minutes, not seconds" in the
normal case but which Anthropic's SLA allows up to ~24h in the worst case;
its workflow's `timeout-minutes: 90` is deliberately generous, not tight.

**GitHub Actions minutes aren't unlimited on a private repo** — unlike
Render Cron Jobs (a flat plan cost), GitHub Free private repos get a monthly
Actions minutes allowance (check your plan's current limit; it's been
2,000 min/month historically) before minutes start billing per-use. Five
short daily/hourly jobs plus a weekly backup comfortably fit within that in
normal operation, but if `qgen-topup` starts routinely running long (see
above), or you add more scheduled workflows later, this ₹0 assumption is
worth re-checking against your repo's actual Actions usage (Settings →
Billing) — the free web-hosting tiers being ₹0 doesn't automatically mean
CI/cron compute is unlimited too.

#### Required GitHub repo secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions)

| Secret | Used by |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL` | all five job workflows |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | all five job workflows |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `ca-run`, `qgen-topup` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | `ca-run`, `qgen-topup` (embeddings, for dedup/RAG) |
| `QGEN_BATCH_MAX_USD` | `qgen-topup` (optional — falls back to `5` if unset) |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` / `VAPID_SUBJECT` | `notifications` |
| `SUPABASE_DB_URL` | `backup` only — see below, this must be the **Session pooler** connection string, NOT the direct `db.<ref>.supabase.co` host |
| `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` | `backup` only |

### Weekly encrypted DB backup

`backup.yml` runs Sundays: `pg_dump` (custom format, via a freshly-installed
latest `postgresql-client` from the official PGDG apt repo — avoids a
client/server major-version mismatch, since Ubuntu's default apt repo can lag
behind whatever Postgres version Supabase runs; live-verified against a real
`ubuntu:24.04` container, the same image `ubuntu-latest` currently resolves
to) → piped through `gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo AES256` (live-verified
headless/batch — no pinentry prompt, no TTY needed) → uploaded as a
90-day-retention Actions artifact. **The plaintext dump is deleted
immediately after encryption and never uploaded** — Actions artifacts are
downloadable by anyone with repo read access, so an unencrypted dump would be
a real leak, not a hypothetical one.

**Scoped to `--schema=public --extension=pgcrypto --extension=vector`**, not
a full-database dump. A full `pg_dump` of a Supabase project also captures
`auth.users` (real emails + hashed passwords), storage object metadata, and
other Supabase-managed schemas — this app doesn't own that data and
Supabase's own point-in-time backups already cover it, so there's no reason
for this second, independent backup to collect it too. Live-verified (Docker,
pg_dump 17.10) that `--schema=public` alone silently drops the
`CREATE EXTENSION` statements for `pgcrypto`/`vector` (both installed into
the `extensions` schema by `supabase/migrations/0001_extensions.sql`, and
referenced by public-schema column defaults/types) — pg_dump excludes
extensions from a schema-filtered dump unless named explicitly via
`--extension`, even if `extensions` is itself included in the `--schema`
list. Also live-verified the fix: with both flags, restoring into a target
that already has the `extensions` schema present (true of any real Supabase
project) correctly recreates the extensions from the dump's own
`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS` statements — no manual pre-step needed.

**IMPORTANT — GitHub-hosted runners do not have reliable outbound IPv6.**
Supabase's *direct* connection host (`db.<ref>.supabase.co`, used elsewhere in
this repo for `supabase db push` — see the `supabase-headless-migrations`
memory) is IPv6-only and will hang/time out from a GitHub Actions runner.
`SUPABASE_DB_URL` must instead be the **Session pooler** connection string
(IPv4; unlike the Transaction pooler it supports the multi-statement session
`pg_dump` needs) — copy it verbatim, with the real password substituted in,
from Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Database → Connection string →
"Session pooler".

**Restore** (decrypt, then restore into a target whose `extensions` schema
already exists — true of any real Supabase project, so restoring into the
same project or a fresh one both work with no extra step):

```
gpg --decrypt --batch --passphrase "$BACKUP_PASSPHRASE" backup.pgdump.gpg > backup.pgdump
pg_restore --no-owner --no-privileges --clean --if-exists -d "$SUPABASE_DB_URL" backup.pgdump
```

`--clean --if-exists` drops each object before recreating it (`--if-exists`
suppresses errors on a target that doesn't have it yet) — live-verified
end-to-end (Docker: dump → encrypt → decrypt → restore into a fresh
Postgres) that this restores cleanly whether the target is empty or already
has the old data, without hand-editing the command per situation.

**Store `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` in a real password manager, not only as a GitHub
secret.** GitHub secrets are write-only — once set, nothing (not even repo
admins, not the API) can read the value back out. If you lose it anywhere
else, every existing backup artifact becomes permanently undecryptable noise.

## One-time deploy setup (manual — needs your accounts/credentials)

1. **Cloudflare Pages**: dashboard → Workers & Pages → Create → Pages →
   connect the repo. Set build command/output/root directory and env vars
   exactly as in the "Cloudflare Pages" section above.
2. **Render**: New → Web Service (not Blueprint, unless you've locally edited
   `render.yaml`'s `plan: starter` to `plan: free` for your own use — the
   checked-in file stays `starter` since it's the paid-path reference).
   Connect the repo, Dockerfile path `apps/api/Dockerfile`, plan **Free**.
   Fill in every env var listed in the "Render (API)" section above.
3. **UptimeRobot** (or any free uptime monitor): add an HTTP(S) monitor
   against `https://<render-service>.onrender.com/api/v1/health`, 5-minute
   interval, to reduce (not eliminate) free-tier cold starts.
4. **GitHub Actions secrets**: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions →
   add every secret in the table above.
5. **Domain**: point it at Cloudflare Pages (per Cloudflare's custom-domain
   instructions) for the web app; the API can stay on its `onrender.com`
   subdomain or get its own `api.<domain>` CNAME via Render's custom domain
   flow. Update `VITE_API_URL` (Pages) and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (Render) once a
   real domain is live — do this before the Razorpay/Google steps below,
   since both need the real prod URL.
6. **Razorpay**: switch from test to live keys when ready for real payments
   (separate key pair from test mode). Dashboard → Webhooks → add
   `https://<api-host>/api/v1/billing/webhook`, copy the webhook secret into
   Render's `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
7. **Google OAuth** (still pending per CLAUDE.md's TODO list — not part of
   this deploy pass): Google Cloud Console redirect URI
   `https://<supabase-project>.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`; Supabase Auth →
   Providers → Google; Supabase Auth → URL Configuration → add the prod
   origin to the Site URL/redirect allowlist.
8. **Supabase prod hardening**: enable point-in-time backups (Database →
   Backups) as the primary safety net (the weekly GitHub Actions backup above
   is a cheap independent second copy, not a replacement), confirm Storage
   CORS on the `answer-images` bucket allows the prod origin, confirm Auth →
   URL Configuration lists the prod origin (not just `localhost:3000`).

Then run `docs/launch-checklist.md` end to end against the real URLs before
tagging `v1.0.0`.

## Upgrading to paid (when there's revenue to justify it)

The ₹0 stack's ceiling is real: Render free cold starts, no first-class cron
run history/retries, and Cloudflare Pages' own free-tier limits. When it's
worth paying for headroom:

- **Web → Vercel**: `apps/web/vercel.json` is already committed and
  deployable as-is — import the repo in Vercel, Root Directory `apps/web`,
  framework preset Vite, same `VITE_*` env vars as the Cloudflare Pages
  section above. See the "Prerendering" section below for Vercel's serving
  behavior (no trailing-slash redirect, unlike Cloudflare).
- **API + cron → Render Starter**: `render.yaml` is already committed and
  deployable as-is via Render's Blueprint flow ("New → Blueprint", connect
  the repo) — it provisions the always-on Starter web service AND all five
  Render Cron Jobs in one shot, replacing the GitHub Actions workflows with
  Render's own first-class cron (per-job run history/retries/logs). Fill in
  every `sync: false` value in the `prayasup-secrets` env var group via the
  dashboard.
- **Turn off the GitHub Actions workflows once Render Cron Jobs take over**
  — disable them from the repo's Actions tab (Settings → Actions → General,
  or per-workflow "..." → Disable workflow) rather than deleting the files,
  in case you ever need to fall back. Running both at once double-executes
  every job (harmless for idempotent ones like `ca:run`, but wasteful spend
  for `qgen:topup`).
- Update `VITE_API_URL` (Vercel) and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`/`ALLOWED_ORIGIN_SUFFIXES`
  (Render) to match whichever domain now points where.

## Weekly ops routine (~30–60 min/week)

- **Content**: `pnpm content:fetch` to pull any newly-released UPPSC PDFs
  (papers, syllabus updates); re-run the relevant `ingest:*` scripts if new
  content lands mid-cycle rather than waiting for the next exam year.
- **Review Queue** (`/admin/review`, `is_admin` gated): ~15 min/day —
  approve/edit/reject `needs_review` questions, notes, and community reports.
  Don't let this queue back up; qgen/notes generation both write here, not
  straight to published.
- **Reported questions** (Review Queue → "Reported" tab): triage user "Report
  this question" complaints. Each card shows the question with full provenance
  (source_kind, generation prompt_version, exam/year, whether the official key
  is verified) and every open report. Actions: **fix key** (corrects the key and
  clears the stale explanation so it regenerates grounded), **regenerate
  explanation** (grounded, argues for the key; if the key-support check disputes
  the key it flags for you instead of writing), **unpublish**, **dismiss**. A
  question with **two independent reports is auto-unpublished** pending your
  review, so the highest-signal defects hide themselves.
- **Current-affairs source review**: spot-check the `ca-run` workflow's
  output weekly — RSS feeds go dead or change format without warning (this
  already happened once with PIB/UP-government feeds during initial
  sourcing — see CLAUDE.md Session 12). If a source stops producing items,
  find and swap in a replacement in `src/ca/sources.ts`.
- **Cost check + question-bank quality**: `pnpm --filter api cost:report
  [--days 7]` — watch for per-evaluation / per-CA-run cost drift and cache-hit-
  rate dropping (prompt-cache misses are the single biggest lever on Anthropic
  spend here). The report now ends with a **Question-bank quality** table
  (published MCQs by `source_kind` + generation `prompt_version`) fed by the
  `question_quality` view, and prints **QUALITY ALERTS** when a cohort exceeds a
  threshold:
  - **report rate > 2%** — too many of a cohort's published MCQs are drawing
    user reports; something systemic is wrong with that source/prompt version.
  - **inconsistency rate > 1%** — the consistency sweep is flagging too many
    explanation-vs-key or bilingual-option mismatches.
  - **re-solve disagreement > 5%** — the blind re-solve audit disagrees with the
    stored key too often (for `generated`/`manual` cohorts this points at wrong
    keys; for official-key PYQ cohorts a disagreement is usually the model, not
    the bank — investigate before acting).
  On an alert, run the audits below and triage the Reported-questions tab. Update
  `lib/models.ts`'s `standard` pricing once Anthropic publishes real post-intro
  prices (still a placeholder — see CLAUDE.md TODO list).
- **Question-bank trust audits** (run monthly, or when a quality alert fires):
  - `pnpm --filter api audit:consistency [--hide]` — every published MCQ:
    structural/bilingual integrity + an explanation-vs-key check (haiku, Batch
    API) for the ones that have an explanation. Cheap (~$0.01/full bank). Records
    one `question_audits` row per question; resumable via `--run-id`. Read-only
    by default; `--hide` also unpublishes each flagged question pending review.
  - `pnpm --filter api audit:resolve [--sample N | --all] [--hide]
    [--max-usd N]` — independently re-solves questions (no key/explanation, WITH
    RAG grounding; haiku easy/medium, sonnet hard, Batch API), and escalates any
    disagreement to a sonnet + `web_search` fact-check with citations. A
    persistent disagreement is flagged (and `--hide`-eligible), **except** for
    official-answer-key PYQs, whose stored key is ground truth — those are
    surfaced but never auto-hidden. Cost-capped (`--max-usd`, default 12) and
    resumable. Both write the `question_quality` numbers the cost report reads.
- **Evaluation prompt tuning**: `pnpm --filter api eval:answers --runs 3` —
  gates on ranking (good > mediocre > off-topic) and repeatability (≤5% of
  full marks). Re-run after any prompt change in `src/services/evaluation/`.
- **Backup sanity check**: confirm the weekly `backup.yml` run actually
  succeeded (Actions tab) and that `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` is still recoverable
  from your password manager — an untested backup is not a backup.

## Prerendering (deliberately not wired into either host's default build)

`apps/web/scripts/prerender.mjs` snapshots `/en`/`/hi`/`/en/pricing`/
`/hi/pricing` via a real headless Chromium after the build — genuinely useful
for SEO/OG tags, but it needs a Playwright Chromium binary present at build
time, which is fragile on a managed build image you don't control (missing
system libs, no root for `apt-get`, etc. — real failure modes, not
hypothetical). The codebase already keeps `prerender` as a separate step from
`build` for exactly this reason (see the script's own header comment).
Neither the Cloudflare Pages build command above nor `vercel.json`'s
`buildCommand` runs it by default, in favor of a build that reliably succeeds
every time.

Serving behavior differs by host (both verified live, see the Cloudflare
Pages section above for the `wrangler pages dev` session):

- **Vercel**: resolves `/en` → `dist/en/index.html` directly, no redirect.
- **Cloudflare Pages**: 308-redirects `/en` → `/en/` before serving
  `dist/en/index.html` — a real, disclosed difference (see the trailing-slash
  gotcha above), not a bug in either config.
- `vite preview`'s bundled dev server, for comparison, only resolves the
  clean URL with an explicit trailing slash (`/en/`), matching neither host's
  production behavior exactly — don't use it as the reference for how a real
  deploy resolves these paths.

If you want prerendering live: run `pnpm --filter web build:ci` (build +
prerender chained) in a CI job with Playwright's Chromium installed, then
publish that `dist/` — either as Cloudflare Pages' build output (its build
image does support installing browser dependencies, unlike Vercel's more
locked-down managed image, but test this yourself before trusting it in
production) or via `vercel.json`'s `buildCommand` changed to
`npx playwright install chromium && pnpm run build:ci`. Watch the build logs
closely the first few times either way before trusting it.
